I love being an entrepreneur. Below is a general overview of my product methodology.

#### Ideation and Product Creation
Brainstorming ideas into user stories and requirements like a Product Manager. This takes time, I often get good ideas when I am trying a new recipe or enjoying the beauty of the natural stream that runs past my house.

- often overlooked by startups who think they can get by
- being able to visualize and work through an entire customer journey from beginning to end



#### Project Planning and Management
A single snowflake of a product idea often feels like an avalanche once all the details and ideas start flowing.
Agile, kanban and scrum to keep me on track like a Project Manager would.

#### Engineering Knowhow
I can easily and openly say I will never be the most technically experienced developer in any one field, for that I'd probably want a PhD. Instad, I know how to research, evaluate and teach myself. Similar to 'just-in-time' production methodology, I believe in the power of learning what I need when I need it and applying it directly. 

Code modularity is an important factor.

TDD is an amazing ideal, but lacking a dedicated product team to generate all the details and edge cases can make creating a proper set of tests a challenge. Often, taking the time to put the tests in after the code exists but before the feature ships can be good enough.
