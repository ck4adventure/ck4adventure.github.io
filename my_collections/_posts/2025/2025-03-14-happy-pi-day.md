I've slowed a little in my progress on Javascript, but it's been worth the extra time refreshing myself on object prototypes, the nomenclature around functions, declarations and expressions, and closures, just to name a few. 

Still making small progress on my recipe app most days. Once I get better testing put in I definitely want to deploy what I have and then keep working in little features as I can.
