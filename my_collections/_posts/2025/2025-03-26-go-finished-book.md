Today I finished reading through The Practical Guide to Go, and feel fairly confident in my knowledge of the basics of the language again. Nuances and common design patterns are up next for learning topics.

In project work I've focused lately on building up a golang api backend for my recipe app. The idea is to get them to a level of feature parity, keeping me fluent in both as I go.
