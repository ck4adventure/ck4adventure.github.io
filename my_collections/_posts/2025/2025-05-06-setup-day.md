# Setup Day

After an initial plan, a break, review and some rewrites, this is the first day of setting up docs and repos to build a Bakery Inventory Management App. ChatGPT4o has been assisting with the details of what needs to happen, especially around b2b security. It has been very useful in giving me the broader overview of what I am building, and is especially good at taking a larger concept and breaking it into smaller tasks, something that I have historically struggled at. I feel more confident in taking on this level of a project than I ever have before.

I have decided to use 3 separate repos. This one will hold all the documentation, feature planning, schemas, etc, mostly because I plan on having separate backend and frontend repos and couldn't decide which one to use for the higher level planning. At the moment I am also foregoing Jira in favor of just running through the checklists I am generating in order to save time and effort, since it is just me creating this for now.
