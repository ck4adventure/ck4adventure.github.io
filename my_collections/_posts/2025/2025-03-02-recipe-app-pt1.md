Just wanted to keep track of things as I learn them and remind myself of my progress.

- react-lucide seems to be a pretty spiffy free icon library
- struggled my way through an issue to find out react-hook-form's useFieldArray only allows objects, solution found by confirming my suspicion with chat-gpt and then using its code snippets to implement the answer more quickly, instead of `[""]`, it is now `[{ "value": ""}]`
- using chatgpt for small modifications given specific requirements works fairly well
