I am still enjoying re-learning go more than I expected. It makes a lot more sense to me now after a couple of online courses last fall and my own work with Typescript. I really think this might be how I can help distinguish myself amongst this sea of out-of-work devs. At the very least, it is deepening my understanding of object oriented programming as well as how to work with concurrency. 

I am slowly dropping all of my gui based tools in favor of using shortcuts and keybindings to move my cursor and the terminal to curl my api instead of postman. This really does bring better efficiency and just saves my arm/shoulder from having to use the mouse so much. I prefer things that have a nice asthetic, but this is an area where less is now more.
