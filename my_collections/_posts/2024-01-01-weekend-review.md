I got the itch to see just how hard it would be to get a `dockerized` Django app into production this weekend and it took quite a bit. There aren't a lot of notes from trying out all the different things and reading various tutorials. Most start out with a specific template with all their internal settings figured out. But it's exactly the little details of getting Django production ready that are still missing. I did however learn/remember quite a bit of docker and could successfully locally run my django app in a container. It was just getting it deployed with an apache server and in production mode that became more challenging.

Bejeweled was a really fun game from the early 2000s and is also something that I'd like to someday code for myself. I found [a good example](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/06/24/new-game-source-code-gemgem-a-bejeweled-clone/) by the same author of Automate the Boring Stuff. After spending a day on it Sunday to give myself a break from docker, I realized learning game logic in no way helps me forward on my career hunt so that will wait a while until I get other projects out.

Sunday evening and Monday was back to Django. I feel I just don't know enough quite yet, so it's back to the Django docs with my newly gained knowledge of Python basics. I also found another source of wisdom that I think will help [Becoming an Enterprise Django Engineer](https://www.scribd.com/document/619193574/M-Dinder-Becoming-an-Enterprise-Django-Developer-Discover-Best-Practices-Tooling-And-Solutions-for-Writing-and-Organizing-Django-Applications-in) on a free trial from `Scribd`
