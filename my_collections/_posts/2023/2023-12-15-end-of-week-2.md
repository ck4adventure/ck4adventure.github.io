Monday started out ok, but I got to the point where I realized I needed a lot more fake data in my app to be able to have a nice list of fitness classes and do user type things with them. Tuesday and Wednesday were spent relearning some of the intricacies of Redux, but the work proved super useful, as deep in the redux docs are some great examples of how to organize state for a larger store. Thursday was a bit of shaping my own state and also applying for jobs. And due to an error in judgement in my own cooking, Friday was a day off. 

It's hard to track all the ideas I've had and put into confluence as well, but the checklist of production items continues to grow. For example, in interacting with current products utilized by my dance studios I get frustrated when I can't clear a selection easily, so that went on the list. Things like analytics, an email server, a marketing website, those will all need to be in place. And not to mention building custom data migrators for whatever shape of data every other product on the market exports in.
