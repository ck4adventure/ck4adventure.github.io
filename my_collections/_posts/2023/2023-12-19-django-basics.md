### Project Setup
- Ensure virtual env and `souce ./venv/bin/activate`
- Ensure it's the python version wanted `python --version`
- Ensure it's the django version wanted `python -m django --version`
- Create new project with `django-admin startproject <name>`
- Ensure project runs with `python manage.py runserver` and visit the url in the output.

### App Setup
From the root project folder `python manage.py startapp <name>`

- Configure view (what in rails is a controller)
- Configure URL (what in rails is a route)
- Ensure url imported into top level

### DB Setup

Ensure db engine configuration in the `<appname>/settings.py` file. 

Then, run `python manage.py migrate` to run the initial migration for system apps. 

### Adding Models to the DB
For each app that uses a db model, once it is ready to be included in migrations, ensure it is listed under `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` conf.

Run `python manage.py makemigrations <appname>` to scan the models for that app and create any migrations based on the diff.

Run `python manage.py sqlmigrate <appname> <migrationN>` to get a preview of the sql commands autogenerated from that migration.
