What a crazy week this has been. From having my first blundering chat about my career and skills to the incredibly consistent support of people telling me to get my own scheduler app out there, to losing a dear friend of the family from my childhood, and finally realizing I need a much deeper understanding of Typescript, there hasn't been a dull day yet. 

My code journey started last week with setting up a basic vite react project, adding MUI, and refresing myself on the basics of working with components. I got to a nice calendar page with dummy data and a date picker. 

After a call monday, I realized I wanted to share my sharing algo work, and so Tuesday was spent setting up an express backend with the latest Node and having fun using es6. I got a good framework laid out for creating the "flowers" feature, leaving it at the point of begging the TDD of the feature itself.

Wed and Thursday were a bit harder. A friend of my grandparents passed away, and the grief hit me pretty hard Wednesday afternoon. But still I wanted to get back to my app and keep forging ahead on a demo with sample state.

So after struggling yet again with ts syntax and errors while trying to put in a react redux store, I decided it was time to go back to the basics and really dig in to the details of the language, and I am glad I have.

Things I am alerady learning reading the typescript book:

- try not to use the `any` type, it's a crutch
- you can indeed type the return value of a function
- tsc configs of `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks` are basically must-do
- `& and |` work as intersection and union in the type space
- how to type an arrow function the right way
