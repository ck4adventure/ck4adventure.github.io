 In returning to the sharing algo and trying to recreate that dataset I am realizing just how naive a solution it was. Since numerically sequential ids were used inside the spreadsheet, I am stuck using that same pattern again to replicate the data form necessary. There is a huge lesson to be learned here to spot bad data-handling practices earlier and be willing to say something. I'd just never run into anything so blatantly wrong before.
