So it turns out that a many-to-many using a custom joins table is really hard to display in the admin by default. But, I think it isn't impossible, I just have to keep reading the docs and seeking out examples online. I did find quite a few good python resources, including the Jazzband org on github, which seems pretty cool and offers a look into semi-production code bases.
