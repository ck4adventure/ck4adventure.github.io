### PSQL

### Updating
pg will automatically run through a table and change values for you:
```sql
UPDATE weather
SET temp_hi = temp_hi - 2,  temp_lo = temp_lo - 2
WHERE date > '1994-11-28';
```

### Deleting
And it can delete things for you:
```sql
DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';
```

BEWARE using DELETE improperly, as this will wipe the entire table clean:
```sql
DELETE FROM tablename;
```
