### Ingredients
1/2 c whole wheat flour
1/3 c all purpose flour
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder

1/2 c whole milk yogurt

### Directions
1. Whisk whole wheat flour, salt, baking powder, and 1/3 cup all-purpose flour in a medium bowl. Stir in yogurt. Transfer dough to a clean work surface and knead until mostly smooth, about 1 minute. Divide into 2 pieces and wrap with plastic. Let rest 15 minutes to let dough relax.

2. Working one at a time, roll out dough on a lightly floured surface, sprinkling dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking, to about â…›" thick.

3. Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Cook flatbread until underside is golden brown and puffy with a few charred spots, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook on other side until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate, then repeat with remaining dough.
