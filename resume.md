### EXPERIENCE
**SynthesisAI, Software Engineer**  
San Francisco, Feb 2021 - Dec 2023
- Learned golang and quickly began contributing to the code bases that form the product (CLI, API server, content generation pipeline, FE). Refactored a section of the api server code to be more modular, simplifying future feature adds
 - Owned product feature implementations: designed json specification for customer input, solved the domain logic and updated API endpoints, coordinated with the CG team for their needed input for their pipeline, following up post implementation by running the product to do a visual QA and outputs check, writing the docs and coordinating release to production
 - Solved domain logic challenges: created a complex query involving a shared pool of randomized results optimally distributed within specified subgroups while preventing duplicates. Implemented content metadata as a way to abstract building tedious lists and provide complex filtering of parameters, simplifying the user experience tenfold
 - Microservice architecture: Designed and built a custom CMS (MERN stack) for the metadata attached to our CG content data, reducing update time from 30 min full code deployment to a fractions of a second hitting an endpoint
