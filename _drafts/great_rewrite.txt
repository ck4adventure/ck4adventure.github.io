Great Re-Write of 20/20
Real Laws for Real People
1. 2018 for organizing initiatives and getting measures on ballots
2. 2019 for structural implementation across all jurisdictions which have agreed
3. Basic Framework will be proposed, but with the idea that it is guidelines, one size never fits all 
     - commission of a certain number of people, none may ever have served on the govt
     - none may be 1st or 2nd level business contacts to those in power
     - almost like a grand jury, you want it to be cross section of normal people
     - ratio of law-guides to jurists, scholars or professionals with again, no previous ties or vested interest in the process
     - and no final vote, only guidance and information
4. Begin a 3 month to year long review of the applicable code of law they are auditing
    - Using a pre-vetted mandate and guidelines, they get to change their laws
    - Criminal code, all offenses will be measured against harm to society, public good and self
    - if no serious threat found other than possible detriment to self, possibly strike law (drugs, homosexuality, etc)
5. This radical freedom granting guideline
    - based on the best version of human rights a panel can come up with
    - it will also be revised every cycle to reflect any new discoveries or paradigm shifts
    - limitation is that it may only be edited to grant more freedoms to more beings, never less
    - it will be the definitive guide on free speech, right to do to your body, proper age of minors given the socio-economic conditions, etc
6. There will be a lot of fear, if we could ever get a community to be willing, but it would be worth it.
