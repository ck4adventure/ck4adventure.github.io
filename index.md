[Snowscene](https://ck4adventure.github.io/snowscene/), one of my first projects, is a page with falling "snow" and a few controls such as size and wind speed.

[Cascades](https://staging.dg4eq98l6f66l.amplifyapp.com/) created November 2024 is a tile swapping match-3 game where the tiles cascade down to fill in the empty spaces.
