<p>POC project &nbsp;<b>Recipe Manager</b>, an app to help me manage the ingredients and labeling for my weekend home bakery business. First feature includes database relations of a product which has many recipes, with each recipe having many ingredients, each ingredient with a list of one or many ingredients, and possibly its own recipe. Main goal was to simplify the printing of ingredient labels and allergen warnings for my bakery products.<a href="https://github.com/ck4adventure/recipe_app_nextjs">&nbsp;github only</a></p>
