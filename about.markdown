I knew way back in high school that I wanted to work with computers. It was sometimes a winding path, including a couple years of rocket science, an MA in German literature, and my own bootstrapped climb into first iOS then the web - yet has brought me a wide skillset of tools for success:

#### Frontend Engineer

- js/html/css: sometimes the simplest solution really is the best one
- pug/mustache/templating: the use of templates, partials and interpolated values can really speed up a project that needs to display a lot of information, reliably and uniformly
- static site generators: jekyll and metalsmith on the lighter side, Gatsby as a way for me to learn GraphQL, static site generators are a handy way to build large sites, quickly
- react/redux frameworks: because dynamic webapps serving up complex user experiences are way more fun!

#### UX Engineer

- create user stories: understanding your users and then shifting your product to meet their needs is what can take a mediocre app and makes it delightful
- figma mockups and wireframes: these are the best way to try it out before you commit
- uikits and design systems: can be critical to providing good UX through uniform appearance, affordance, and functionality, especially once a project starts to grow
- error handling: everyone loves it when things go right, but what happens when something goes wrong? good UX is covering all the edge cases so that the customer never feels abandoned along their journey

#### Additional Areas

- Backend Engineer: basic Ruby/Rails knowledge, along with Postgresql
- Product Owner/Designer/Manager: whatever you call it, tell me what you want the app to do and I can draft a set of user stories, meet with the team to discuss implementation details and come up with a set of design docs, incl acceptance criteria and basic QA
- Small Business Management: fun fact, I was the payroll accountant, then took over as the accountant/controller (7 months) of a set of farming partnerships totaling 2,000 acres of cherries and walnuts
