Kitty, as she is usually called, is 18, has bad hips, and now gets medicated for chronic pain. She does a lot better on the medicine, less wailing in the middle of the day/night, more sleeping for us humans. She is still annoying, but back to her normal level of annoying. And last night she apparently was feeling so much better that she decided to spring up into the window and venture onto the windowsill for some fresh air.

But you have to understand this cat. This cat is old, really old. Like, she can’t even wash herself any more. We brush her and cut the matts out as they form. We brought her litter to the upstairs bathroom because she couldn’t get up and down the stairs so well anymore. Kitty is skinny, picky about what she eats, and not exactly steady on her feet. Oftentimes when she is standing she will sway slightly trying to stand upright. But she also still really loves humans, and still loves to get her chin and jaw rubbed as long as you can keep doing it.

And me? I was sitting on the floor, trying to meditate. I had opened the window and left it ajar for some air before sitting down. I had even pulled the window shut a little to be more narrow, because I was afraid the cat would want to try to go outside, because there was just enough of little ledge to walk on outside the window, but a long drop to the cement below.

And so there I am, sitting with my eyes closed when the thump, thump and clack clack of nails register somewhere in my consciousness and my consciousness does whatever it does to compare those sounds - and I realize the cat has jumped up to the window. And no sooner do I get my eyes open and get up to go grab the cat before she can do anything stupid...I see her standing on the sill (on the outside!) and then vanish from sight. I can’t believe my eyes.

Not even wanting to lose the time it would take me to go to my window and look, I gather myself and head for the stairs, mind already racing, barely managing to get my voice to work enough to yell to Julie to wake up, her cat just jumped out of the window. By the time I’m halfway down the stairs, I already have run through the scenario and evaluated likely outcomes. That was a tall drop and a cement path directly below. The branches of the bush are too skinny and grow to high to hold her weight or do much of anything. She was medicated and swaying before she even jumped up there. The probabilities flashing through my thoughts aren't pretty.

I get down the stairs to the front hall and realize the cat is in the backyard, by the time I am down that hall and steps and turning the deadbolt Julie is up out of bed and right behind me. I’m already coursing with adrenaline, prepared for the worst. But as soon as I get a few steps outside, here comes kitty, looking very confused, but completely intact, walking towards us on shaky feet. I quickly scoop her up, everyone back inside, and check her over for any noticeable injuries. Nothing. After a couple shots of raspberry schnapps I am finally calm enough to head back to bed. Julie does the same.

I still am not completely sure if that cat actually jumped down and knew what she was doing, or if she fell down and somehow managed to land in the bush and down to the dirt without breaking anything. She wasn’t really dirty, nor does she seem to have any injuries. But if you would see how off-balance she is day in and day out, it is a wonder she walked away from that, regardless of how she went down.

Update a few days later: Kitty seems to be just fine, or at least only slightly slower than usual. She hesitated jumping up to that window for a few days, which tells me she remembered it was unpleasant. I still can't figure out how she fell and/or landed without breaking anything, including her neck or back.
