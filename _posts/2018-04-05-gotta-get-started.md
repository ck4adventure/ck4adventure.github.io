It’s like my mind swirls with ten or twelve different conversations at once and so picking one out long enough to form a coherent post gets hard. Or like I travel along this associative thought pattern as it weaves its way across my unconscious. My thoughts are so broad that it is sometimes difficult to form them into sentences and paragraphs.

But here I try, because I feel the need to share. Why? Does there have to be a why? I suppose 42 would be as good an answer as any.

I seem to be on the search for something. What it is exactly I don’t know. For the Stephen King fans out there, I would liken it to Roland’s quest for the dark tower, you don’t know exactly what it is or how to get there, but you know you have to find it. The rest you figure out along the way.

Creativity seems to be a recurring theme in my life right now, so that will be something I try to explore more. And flow. Being able to calm and quiet my thoughts so that I am just doing, that is a goal as well.
