So by chance I'm in the first car of the Richmond bound BART, we're leaving 19th/Oakland, most of us having just boarded as transfers from the City. It’s about quarter after ten at night, the train is full of people all just trying to get home. I’m reading a book, not really tuned in to much of anything.  I do realize we are going very slow in the tunnel. Slow enough that after a while it’s really noticeable. Slow enough that suddenly we are… stopping?

I turn around to look to the front, curious. Here comes a second engineer from the driver’s compartment, down past the people sitting, all the way to the first door. I figure oh shit, we’re having train trouble. But suddenly he’s opening the door manually, and here is this transient, probably late 40s, with his crap, climbing up into the train car.

The transient goes and finds a place to sit, tells them how grateful he is for being picked up underway like that. A few astonished murmurs go through. The door is closed, the engineer walks back up and we start back up to almost normal speed. People try not to stare, and as it becomes apparent that the engineers aren’t about to do anything else, we all kind of just sit there and continue on.

Finally, still at slower speeds, we pull into MacArthur. I was sure there would be police waiting on the platform. No one in sight. The engineer and small group of station staff at the front kind of looked around, but no one said anything, everyone was just super calm.

A few of the passengers weren’t so calm, with one young woman demanding he have a ticket. I was still certain there had to be some consequence to this, but wasn’t sure what. We just kept sitting there, and after a min the transient decided this wasn’t his train after all, and gets his stuff to go. More outrage from the passengers.

But out on the platform I heard a strong command, “Don’t do it. Don’t do it.” I figured oh shit, here he goes again down a different track. But luckily, that happened to be the police officer, and in short order they were walking peacefully to the escalator down.

Never a dull ride on the BART.
