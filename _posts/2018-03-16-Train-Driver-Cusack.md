My BART train driver seems to be channeling John Cusack. Like from the 90s. Exactly as the stereotypical character one would expect if you distilled his most famous character roles into one. He had the same tone of voice, the same pitch and pattern. He talked nonstop for about three station stops, filling the time in between driving, repeatedly stating the stop, the destination, and any other information he thought you might need. His voice held a little bit of excitement as he talked on about this stop and the next. He was a little anxious too, like a boyish uncertainty about all the excitement he had. And that same slightly distracted quality that was so charming in the movies. Had he not operated the train so smoothly, it almost lent weight to the belief we had been hijacked, no other operator (not even Mr. Flaming "*my doors are closing*") ever talked this much. Our train conductor actually cut himself off from talking so the could close the doors and get the train moving. Once we were on the way he would start up a new monologue again, always with that enthusiasm.

Once we got to Oakland, he stopped, and went back to regular announcements again. Strange world sometimes.
