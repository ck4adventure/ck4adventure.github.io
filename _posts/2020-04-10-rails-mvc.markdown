Now that we have objects in our database and have written validations to make sure we can save them successfully for each create and update, it's time to write the rails backend to hook into that.

## Set basic routes

`/config/routes.rb`

`resources :users`

Which creates the following:

```ruby
get '/users', to: 'users#index', as: 'users'
post '/users', to: 'users#create'
get '/users/new', to: 'users#new', as: 'new_user'
get '/users/:id/edit', to: 'users#edit', as: 'edit_user'
get '/users/:id', to: 'users#show', as: 'user'
patch '/users/:id', to: 'users#update'
put '/users/:id', to: 'users#update'
delete '/user/:id', to: 'users#destroy'
```

## Create some Models

Each resource will need to have a controller to handle each of the resource actions listed above.

So the `users_controller.rb` should have at the minimum each of the actions above such as `#index`, `#update`, `#destroy`, etc. The controller receives the params from the path, query and body of the incoming http request and is responsible for parsing it and making any queries on the database.

Once those queries are answered, a response is returned along with any other data that controller chooses to pass along back, formatted appropriately through a view.

## Testing with Postman

Make sure to disable the csrf protection for development only.
`/config/application.rb`

Paste in the following with the other config loadings
`config.action_controller.default_protect_from_forgery = false`

Make sure to at least return plain text in any `controller#action` that you want to test else it errors out.

## Write some Views

## Using Models to interact with the db

Models as object oriented ways to interact
cat.rb to model the cats table

```ru
class Cat (class and file name should be same, but different case)
class Cat < ApplicationRecord

end
```

`rails c`

able to call the cat class
`c = Cat.new`
makes a local instance in the rails console without saving to db until you ask for save
`c.name = "Sarah"`
`c.save`

read cat from the db
`Cat.first`

### Annotate Gem

as long as your model files exist with the class skels
`bundle exec annotate --models` (--routes, --controllers, etc)

## Write basic macros for associations

instead of writing out queries, belongs_to and has_many and others are boilerplate ensure functions and checks

```ru
belongs_to :model, {
  primary_key: :id,
  foreign_key: :other_id,
  class_name: 'Class'
}
```

## Complex Asociations

double

```ru
has_many :things
  through: <an association>
  source: <method on the association you're accessing that returns the things>
```

returns an array

```ru
has_one :thing
  through: <name of some association>
  source: <method on there that gets you the rest of the way to the thing>
```

returns single object, uses LIMIT 1
