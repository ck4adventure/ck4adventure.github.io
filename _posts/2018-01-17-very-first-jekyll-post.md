After researching different ways of creating a static site without a lot of pesky server work, I have found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator (SSG) that should meet my needs with enough flexibility in the design and css.

This post is being written after having performed a minimal amount of setup on github. Cool thing is that github supports Jekyll and automatically builds the static pages anytime I push to the repo. I also didn't have to specify anywhere that I was using pages, I simply created the repo along the file structure guidelines and voil√°, I now have static pages and blog posts.
