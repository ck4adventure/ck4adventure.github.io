So as I was having a smoke before bed last night, in my PJs, I hear this whistling noise. Like gas escaping a valve. It is loud, and close. I look around, and finally realize that the neighbor has a kettle going on the stove, and it is hot and whistling. I can’t see much of the kitchen, the blinds are down. But I can see the jet of steam, and the noise, and there really isn’t much else that makes that noise, and not in a kitchen.

I think this is odd, especially since it just keeps going. I go back inside, but there is a tingle at the back of my head that this isn’t right. So I go back out, try to get a better look. I debate what to do, look up the non-emergency line for Berkeley, text my roommate Julie to see if she has the neighbor’s number. I even go ring his doorbell a couple times, no answer.

The kettle is still going through all of this, so once I talk to Julie and she agrees this is strange, I call dispatch and tell them what is going on, neighbors kettle is going, lights on, no movement, yes he’s older, probably over 80, yes he still drives, his car is here, no I can’t see the floor of the kitchen. An officer is on the way.

While I am waiting I go back up to my porch steps where I can peer into the kitchen. It’s been like 15 mins, I already know the threshold for a first response has passed, but I also don’t want to make a big scene over possibly nothing. Suddenly, the shrill sound of the kettle starts to fade slowly, the water has dried up. It finishes the last quiet whistle just as a the police suburban pulls up. I trot back out to greet him and fill him in with what I know.

He rings doorbell and knocks again, then starts his “burglar thing”, by checking all the windows. Immediately he remarks on the buildup of steam on the inside of the frontmost window of the house. Even though I couldn’t really see through the kitchen window, I now know for certain that it was a kettle (I still had had doubts), and that it really did run dry on a hot stove. So the officer keeps moving to the back, looking for signs of entry, or that anyone is home. After a bit he comes back around to the front, he’s been judging his next move. He tells me that he wants to find a way to look in more windows in the back. I tell him I have seen a ladder leaning up against the roof of the house in the back, I can see it from our backyard.

He goes to the back again, I follow along to the back gate. The officer is looking for the ladder, goes too far, I bring him back, and just then he hears voices. Just the tv, he says after a min. So he knocks on the window. This makes him nervous, he tells me, some old people have guns. But the neighbor, Sam is the name I got by text from Julie, answers once through the window, but not again. The officer and I aren’t sure what next.

As we start to head back up front, Julie has also returned home and is dashing over to the neighbors house. I realize he has gone to the front door. So she was there just in time to be talking to him while the officer and I come back around to the front. Once everyone stops talking crosswise long enough, the officer is able to explain that the water kettle was what alerted us, and the neighbor hurried back in to his stove to turn it off. By this time the kettle had apparently started to burn and melt. But we had alerted him in time. It turns out he had been watching Japanese TV in his den with the volume up all the way.

After some more explaining and talking with the police officer, and getting the phone numbers of his daughters, we all went on our way. It felt so great that he was ok, that my instinct proved right, and that no real damage happened.
