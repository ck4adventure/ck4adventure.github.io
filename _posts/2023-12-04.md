sex m/f
eth 6 options

Flowers
size: xs, sm, md,lg, xl
color: red orange yellow green blue purple black white pink
hasThorns: true/false

so a flower entry would be something like
id: 1
size: xs

hasThorns: false


create 10k entries using a randomizer
then recreate the sharing algo
then create an analyzer
