This site is just a fun and easy way for me to get my thoughts and notes organized, and to have published for others to be able to see if they want. It's built using Jekyll, which so far has been a pretty decent tool to work with markdown. 

### Currently Important in My Life
- My pitbull mix Brida and watching her play at the dog park each morning 
- Being fluent in German and getting to enjoy another culture alongside my own 
- Flux Vertical Theatre for dance and fitness 
- Successfully growing tasty veggies in the challenging Bay Area microclimate 
- Learning to bake french patisserie and other difficult desserts
- A good adrenaline rush once in a while
